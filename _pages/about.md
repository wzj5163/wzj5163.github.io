Hello there! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+economics+and+finance/phd+students/copia+di+current+phd+students+in+economics+_+finance_acquati+2011+09+30+11+21">Bocconi University</a>
in Milan, Italy. 

I am interested in **causal analysis** in the field of **Political Economics**. 
Specifically, I want to contribute to our understanding of how the design of our social and economic system affects how we think about the world.

Over the next years, I will share my research and possibly other interesting insights on this website. Stay tuned! :rocket:
