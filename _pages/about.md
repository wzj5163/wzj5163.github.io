Hello! I am a fifth-year PhD student in mathematic finance at 
<a target="_blank" href="https://e.swufe.edu.cn">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)</a>
in Chengdu, China. 

My research involves corporate default, volatility time series model, multi-factor models, portfolio optimization, and crypocurrency. My research interests include applying **machine learning** and **statistical econometric methods** to solving real-world problems, mainly but not limited in finance. 

My current research focuses are multi-variate network models, deep learning. Hope to share my research findings and insights with you! :rocket:
